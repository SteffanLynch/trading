# Trading Psychology

95% of traders fail.

**Why traders fail:**
1. Poor psychology (emotions, discipline)
2. Poor risk management

Notice that "bad strategy" isn't on the list. Most traders don't fail because their strategy is wrong. They fail because they can't control themselves.

## Emotional Trading

Most people can't get a handle on their emotions when money is on the line. It takes a lot of being exposed to those emotions to be able to conquer them and keep them in check.

### The Emotions You'll Face

**Fear**
- Fear of losing money makes you exit winners too early
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) makes you chase trades you shouldn't take
- Fear of being wrong makes you hesitate on valid setups

**Greed**
- Greed makes you hold winners too long until they turn into losers
- Greed makes you risk too much on "sure things"
- Greed makes you overtrade when you're on a winning streak

**Hope**
- Hope makes you hold losing trades, waiting for them to "come back"
- Hope makes you ignore your stop loss
- Hope is not a strategy

**Frustration/Anger**
- Frustration after losses leads to revenge trading
- Anger makes you abandon your plan and take stupid trades
- One emotional trade can undo a week of good work

### Rules to Follow

- If you're not in the right headspace, don't trade
- No revenge trading - chasing losses only creates more losses
- No "compensation" trading - trying to make back what you lost in one big trade
- No overtrading - more trades doesn't mean more profit
- Don't be a sore loser - you'll lose most of the time anyway. If you can't handle that, don't trade.

### The Hard Truth

Good trading practices are very much counter to our natural instincts.

When things are going well, we are afraid they will stop going well. When things are going bad, we hope they will turn around.

This leads to traders:
- Taking very small gains the moment they're up on a position
- Holding losers for much bigger losses, hoping they'll recover

**The right thing to do:**
- Hold (and even add to) your best positions
- Cut your losers quickly

But that is VERY psychologically hard to train yourself to do. It goes against every instinct. This is why most people fail - not because they don't know what to do, but because they can't make themselves do it.

## Chopping and Changing

One of the biggest mistakes: not giving enough time to a strategy to see it through.

The reality is most strategies work. But not all at the same time. Every strategy has winning periods and losing periods.

If you switch strategies every time you hit a losing streak, you'll never give any strategy the chance to prove itself.

**The problem:**
- You win one time. You lose another.
- How do you know if it was luck or your strategy?
- If it was your strategy, you don't even know which part worked because you changed things each time.

**There has to be consistency.**

You can't make a fair evaluation of something if the conditions keep changing every time. Stick with one approach long enough to gather real data. Only then can you decide if it's working or not.

## Things to Remember

### Right Idea, Wrong Time

Sometimes you could have done nothing wrong. You could have done everything perfectly, but still lose.

That's okay. Don't take it personally. It's not a reflection of your strategy.

The market doesn't owe you anything. Even the best setups fail sometimes. What matters is whether your setup wins more often than it loses over many trades.

Just keep it stepping. Not every trade will be a winner.

### Manage Your Expectations

Trading is not get rich quick.

The game plan is consistency over time. Not big jumps in one move.

**Reality check:**
- It takes most traders on average a couple of years to become profitable
- You will lose most of the time, especially in the beginning
- It doesn't take hundreds of hours - it takes thousands of hours
- It takes several years to become consistent and profitable

It takes education and practice to become successful, and most people skip out on both.

No patience. People want to get rich overnight. After a couple of months when they realise they can't get rich overnight from trading, they just quit.

Don't be that person. Don't rush.

### Trust Your System, Not Yourself

When you're in a trade, your brain will lie to you. It will tell you to move your stop loss. It will tell you to take profit early. It will tell you to hold a loser "just a bit longer."

Don't listen.

Trust the system you built when you were calm and thinking clearly. That version of you made better decisions than the version watching a trade go against you.

If your system says exit, exit. If your system says hold, hold. Remove yourself from the equation.

### Keep It Simple

The more complicated your strategy, the more ways it can break down. The more rules you have, the more likely you are to break them under pressure.

Simple strategies:
- Are easier to follow consistently
- Have fewer moving parts to fail
- Are easier to review and improve

You don't need 10 indicators and 20 rules. You need a few things that work, applied consistently.

## Discipline is Everything

You can have the best strategy in the world. It means nothing if you don't follow it.

Discipline is:
- Taking the trade when your setup appears, even if you're scared
- Not taking a trade when your setup isn't there, even if you're bored
- Following your stop loss, even when it hurts
- Sticking to your position size, even when you're confident
- Walking away after your daily loss limit, even when you want revenge

Discipline isn't about being perfect. It's about following your rules more often than you break them.

---

## The Process Over the Outcome

Don't judge a trade by whether you won or lost. Judge it by whether you followed your plan.

- A winning trade where you broke your rules is a bad trade
- A losing trade where you followed your rules is a good trade

Over time, good process leads to good results. Bad process, even if you get lucky a few times, leads to failure.

Focus on the process. The profits will follow.

## Good to Note

While not necessary, the more you understand your own behaviour and psychology, the better. You'll have a grip on your downfalls and how to combat them.

Pay attention to:
- What emotions trigger your worst decisions?
- What time of day do you make the most mistakes?
- What situations cause you to break your rules?

Self-awareness is a trading edge. Know your weaknesses so you can protect yourself from them.
