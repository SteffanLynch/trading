## What Are Timeframes?

A timeframe is simply how much time each candle represents on your chart.

- **1-minute chart:** Each candle = 1 minute of price action
- **15-minute chart:** Each candle = 15 minutes of price action
- **4-hour chart:** Each candle = 4 hours of price action
- **Daily chart:** Each candle = 1 full trading day

The same price action looks completely different depending on which timeframe you view it on. A wild, choppy day on the 1-minute chart might just be a single candle with wicks on the daily chart.

## Trading Styles by Timeframe

Different trading styles use different timeframes based on how long they hold positions:

| Style | Typical Timeframes | Hold Time |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Scalping** | 1min, 5min | Seconds to minutes |
| **Day Trading** | 5min, 15min, 1H | Minutes to hours (closed by end of day) |
| **Swing Trading** | 1H, 4H, Daily | Days to weeks |
| **Position Trading** | Daily, Weekly, Monthly | Weeks to months |

Choose your style based on how much time you have to watch charts and your personality. Scalping requires constant attention. Swing trading lets you check charts a few times a day.

## The Difference Between Timeframes

Each timeframe gives you a different perspective of the same story.

Lower timeframes multiply activity.
Higher timeframes multiply clarity.

### Higher Timeframes (Daily, 4H, 1H)

- Show the big picture and overall direction
- Less noise - easier to see the real trend
- Less detail - you miss the intraday moves
- Key levels here are stronger and more respected

Higher timeframe zones:
- Absorb more orders
- Survive volatility
- Attract reactions weeks later
- Create asymmetric R:R

### Lower Timeframes (15min, 5min, 1min)

- Show the intraday details
- More noise - easier to get confused or faked out
- More detail - you can find precise entries
- Key levels here are weaker and break more easily

Lower timeframe zones:
- Break more easily
- Fail more often
- Need tighter stops
- Are sensitive to spread/slippage
- Are invalidated by one candle

**Key insight:** Lower timeframes show you the same thing as higher timeframes, just with more detail. If you zoom out on a 15-minute chart, you're essentially looking at a higher timeframe.

**Example:** Choppy, consolidating price action on the 15-minute chart is just a single indecision candle (doji) on the 4-hour chart. Same information, different level of detail.

## The Ocean Analogy

Imagine waves in the ocean:

- Big ocean waves (Daily / 4H)
- Medium waves (1H / 15M)
- Tiny ripples on top (5M / 1M)

All are:
- Real
- Fractal
- Following the same physics

But only some waves can move a boat.

## More Setups ≠ More Opportunities

On lower timeframes:
- More candles
- More swings
- More pullbacks
- More "patterns"
- More noise

So yes, there are more visible cycles and movements. Lower timeframe = more chances for something to look like a setup.

But more setups ≠ more opportunities.

It looks like opportunity... but a lot of it is random movement, not meaningful intent.

Higher timeframes filter this out.

The higher the timeframe, the more participants are involved.

> Higher timeframe creates intent.
> Lower timeframe reveals execution.
> Lower timeframe alone has no authority.

Lower timeframes multiply expressions of the same idea — not independent opportunities.

## Top-Down Analysis

Top-down analysis means starting with higher timeframes to understand the big picture, then moving to lower timeframes for entries.

**The question to always ask:** What larger game is this smaller price action a part of?

### How It Works

1. **Start high (Daily or 4H):** Identify the overall trend direction and major support/resistance levels
2. **Move lower (1H or 15min):** Look for setups that align with the higher timeframe direction
3. **Entry timeframe (5min or 15min):** Find your precise entry point

**Why this matters:** A "perfect" setup on the 5-minute chart means nothing if it's going against the daily trend. The higher timeframe wins.

## What Does Time Do to Price Action?

Time affects how "significant" price action is.

- A level that held for weeks is stronger than one that held for hours
- A trend that's been running for days is more established than one that started this morning
- The longer price consolidates in a range, the bigger the eventual breakout tends to be

Time = more traders seeing and reacting to the same levels = stronger levels.

## Personal Notes

### My Approach to Top-Down Analysis

I don't do top-down the traditional way. Most people switch between timeframes (Daily → 4H → 15min). I find this confusing - I get lost on which markings are for which timeframe.

**What I do instead:** I stay on the same timeframe and just zoom out.

I can figure out what the 4H would look like while on the 15-minute chart by mentally grouping candles together. I can identify the key candles within that group.

But I can't see the 15-minute detail when I'm on the 4H chart - that information is hidden inside each candle.

**The logic:** Zooming out gives you the higher timeframe view. Zooming in (or switching to lower timeframes) gives you more detail. But you can't add detail that isn't there - you have to go to a lower timeframe to see it.
