## The Market is Fractal

The same patterns repeat at every timeframe. A trend on the 1-minute chart looks the same as a trend on the daily chart - just zoomed in or out.

This means:
- The skills you learn on one timeframe apply to all timeframes
- You can use higher timeframes to understand the bigger picture, then drop down to lower timeframes for entries
- What looks like noise on a small timeframe might be a clear pattern on a larger one

## The Market is Cyclical

Markets move in repeating cycles: expansion, contraction, expansion, contraction.

- **Expansion** = Strong directional moves (trending)
- **Contraction** = Tight ranges, consolidation (ranging)

These cycles repeat endlessly. After a big move, expect consolidation. After consolidation, expect a breakout. The market breathes in and out.

## The Market Does Only 2 Things

At any given moment, the market is doing one of two things:

### Rebalancing and Retesting

The market likes to revisit areas it moved through quickly. It "retests" levels to confirm they still hold.

**Your job:** Identify points where the market is likely to return to - previous support/resistance, areas of high volume, or levels where price moved too fast and left "inefficiency" behind.

### Seeking and Destroying

The market hunts for liquidity. It moves toward where the orders are sitting - usually just beyond obvious support/resistance levels where traders place their stops.

**Ask yourself:**
- Where are traders likely to have their stops?
- Where is the obvious level that everyone sees?

The market often spikes through these levels to trigger stops (destroy), then reverses. This is the "stop hunt" or "liquidity grab."

---

## Efficiency vs Inefficiency

The market is largely random and unpredictable in the short term. You cannot predict every move.

**Efficient price action** = Price moves slowly, with overlapping candles, testing both directions. Fair value is being established.

**Inefficient price action** = Price moves fast in one direction with large candles and gaps. The market moved too quickly and may return to "fill" these areas.

Look for inefficient moves - the market often comes back to rebalance them.

---

## The Market Has (Temporary) Memory

The market remembers recent price levels - but not forever. Traders are watching the same charts, so recent highs, lows, and reversal points matter.

**Practical rule:** Look back at recent reversals and areas of interest on the same timeframe you're trading. If you're on a 5-minute chart, the last 5 days of price action is most relevant. Go back further and the memory fades.

---

## What Stimuli Does the Market Respond To?

The biggest moves come from:

- **Economic news** - Scheduled events (Fed announcements, jobs reports, earnings) create volatility and direction
- **Trend reversals** - When a trend exhausts and flips, the move in the new direction is often strong
- **Key support/resistance levels** - Boundaries where price has reversed before. Breaks of these levels trigger big moves as stops get hit and new orders pile in

These are the moments where the market shows its hand. Outside of these, price action is often just noise.

## How Stop Losses and Take Profits Impact the Market

Price moves fastest when people are desperate, and slows when people are willing.

### Stop Loss = Market Order

Stop losses are market orders.

A stop-loss says:

> "If price reaches this level, I want OUT immediately. I do NOT care what price I get."

Why? Because if price is falling fast, you don't care about price anymore — you care about getting out.

That instruction cannot wait.

It turns into:
👉 "Sell/buy right now at whatever price is available"

**Immediately** is the key word.

Because of that, when the stop is triggered, it becomes:
👉 "Execute at whatever price is available right now."

That's why stops can cause **sharp moves** and slippage.

So stops don't cause direction — they accelerate movement when liquidity is thin.

When stops are hit:
- They become market orders
- They apply pressure
- They can push price to the next area where people are willing to trade

#### What Happens When Many Stops Are Hit

Imagine this:
- Many traders bought earlier
- Their stop-losses are all around 1.1950

When price reaches 1.1950:
- All those stop-losses **trigger**
- They all become **sell-now orders**
- They all want out **immediately**

So suddenly:
- A flood of **sell-now** orders hits the market

If:
- Buyers are waiting → price pauses
- Buyers are NOT waiting → price must drop fast

That's why stops can cause **sharp moves**.

They don't *decide* direction — they **add urgency**.

---

### Take Profit = Limit Order

All take profit orders are limit orders.

A take-profit says:

> "If price reaches this level, I am happy to trade at THIS price. If not, I'm fine waiting."

**Willing to wait** is the key word.

Because of that, it must be:
👉 "Execute ONLY at this price."

They:
- Sit and wait
- Provide agreement
- Can slow or stop price

So take profits:
- Often act like temporary resistance/support
- Can cause pauses
- Can cause wicks

But:
They do NOT reverse price on their own.

#### What Happens When Many Take-Profits Are Hit

Now imagine:
- Many traders bought earlier
- Their take-profits are at 1.2100

When price reaches 1.2100:
- Their orders are **already waiting**
- They calmly say: "Sure, I'll sell here."

So when buyers arrive:
- Sellers are ready
- Trades happen
- Price can **pause**
- Price can form **wicks**
- Price can consolidate

Take-profits **do not chase price**.

They **wait to be chosen**.

So they **slow** price instead of accelerating it.

A trade only happens if someone on the other side agrees.

## The Core Difference (Memorise This)

> Stop-losses remove liquidity.
> Take-profits provide liquidity.

### Why Do Stops Accelerate Price But Take-Profits Don't?

Not because of buy vs sell.
Not because of long vs short.
Because of **urgency**.

#### Stops = Urgency

When many stops trigger:
- Many people suddenly say "NOW"
- They accept whatever price exists
- If no one is available at the old price → price jumps

That's acceleration.

#### Take-Profits = Patience

When many take-profits are waiting:
- They are already sitting at a price
- They provide people to trade with
- They allow agreement to happen
- Price can pause or slow

That's why they *don't* accelerate price.
