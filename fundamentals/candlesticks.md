## Anatomy of a Candle

Every candlestick has four key parts:

**Open** - Where the price started for that time period

**Close** - Where the price ended for that time period

**High** - The highest price reached during that time period

**Low** - The lowest price reached during that time period

### Body

The body is the thick part of the candle between the open and close. It shows you who won that battle:
- **Green/White body** = Buyers won (price closed higher than it opened)
- **Red/Black body** = Sellers won (price closed lower than it opened)

The size of the body tells you how decisive the victory was.

### Wicks (Shadows)

The thin lines above and below the body. These are important because they show **rejected price action** - prices that were tested but couldn't hold.

- **Upper wick** = Buyers pushed price up, but sellers rejected it and pushed it back down
- **Lower wick** = Sellers pushed price down, but buyers rejected it and pushed it back up

The longer the wick, the stronger the rejection.

## Types of Candles

There are three main candle types to understand. Each one tells you something different about who's in control.

### Pinbar / Hammer

**What it looks like:** Small body with a long wick on one side

**What it means:** Control shift - someone tried to push price in one direction but got rejected hard. This signals a potential change in control.

- Long lower wick (hammer) = Sellers pushed down but buyers said "no" and pushed it back up
- Long upper wick (shooting star) = Buyers pushed up but sellers said "no" and pushed it back down

**Key point:** The rejection wick should be at least 2x the size of the body to be meaningful.

### Doji

**What it looks like:** Very small or no body, with wicks on both sides

**What it means:** Indecision - no one is in clear control. Buyers and sellers are fighting and neither side can win.

**Key point:** A doji after a strong move can signal that the move is running out of steam. It's not a reversal signal on its own, but a warning sign.

### Momentum Candle

**What it looks like:** Large body with small or no wicks

**What it means:** Strength - there is clear control. One side dominated the entire candle from open to close.

- Big green candle with tiny wicks = Buyers in full control
- Big red candle with tiny wicks = Sellers in full control

**Key point:** The lack of wicks is what makes it powerful. No rejection means no resistance to that move.

## Candlestick Patterns

Candlesticks and their patterns tell a story. A single candle gives you information, but multiple candles together can show you shifts in control and potential reversals.

### Engulfing Candle

**What it looks like:** A candle that completely covers (engulfs) the previous candle's body.

- **Bullish engulfing:** A green candle that engulfs the previous red candle. Shows buyers took over from sellers.
- **Bearish engulfing:** A red candle that engulfs the previous green candle. Shows sellers took over from buyers.

**What it means:** A shift in control. The second candle completely overpowered the first, suggesting the new direction may continue.

**Where to look for it:** Most meaningful at support (bullish engulfing) or resistance (bearish engulfing) levels.

### 3 Bar Reversal Pattern

**What it looks like:** Three candles where:
1. First candle moves in the original direction
2. Second candle is small (indecision or pause)
3. Third candle moves strongly in the opposite direction

**What it means:** The trend tried to continue, stalled, then reversed. The third candle confirms the reversal.

**Key point:** The third candle should be a strong momentum candle in the new direction. If it's weak, the pattern is less reliable.

### Head and Shoulders

**What it looks like:** Three peaks where the middle peak (head) is higher than the two side peaks (shoulders).

```
        Head
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
  L Shoulder  R Shoulder
    /\        /\
   /  \      /  \
  /    \    /    \
---------Neckline---------
```

- **Head and Shoulders (top):** Forms at the top of an uptrend. Signals potential reversal down.
- **Inverse Head and Shoulders (bottom):** Forms at the bottom of a downtrend. Signals potential reversal up.

**How to trade it:** The pattern completes when price breaks the neckline (the line connecting the lows between the peaks). Enter on the break or wait for a retest of the neckline.

**Key point:** The pattern takes time to form. Don't jump in early - wait for the neckline break.

### Double (or Triple) Top/Bottom

**What it looks like:** Price reaches the same level two (or three) times and gets rejected each time.

**Double Top:**
```
    /\    /\
   /  \  /  \
  /    \/    \
       Support
```
Price hits resistance twice, fails to break through both times, then drops.

**Double Bottom:**
```
       Resistance
  \    /\    /
   \  /  \  /
    \/    \/
```
Price hits support twice, fails to break through both times, then rises.

**What it means:** The level is holding strong. After two (or three) failed attempts to break through, the market often reverses.

**How to trade it:** Wait for the "neckline" to break (the swing between the two tops/bottoms). That confirms the reversal.

**Key point:** Triple tops/bottoms are stronger signals than double - three failed attempts shows even more conviction that the level will hold.
