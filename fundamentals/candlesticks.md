## What is a Candle?

A candle is a summary of everything that happened in a time window. It records where buyers and sellers were willing to agree, where they refused, and who still had control when time ended.

## Anatomy of a Candle

Every candlestick has four key parts:

**Open** - Where the price started for that time period

**Close** - Where the price ended for that time period

**High** - The highest price reached during that time period

**Low** - The lowest price reached during that time period

---

### The Open - "Where agreement began"

The open is the price where the first trade of that time window happened. It has no special power - it's just the starting point.

### The Close - "Where agreement ended"

The close is the last price where buyers and sellers agreed when time ran out.

This matters because:
- It shows who had control at the end
- It reflects who was still willing to trade

That's why closes matter more than highs and lows.

---

### The Body - The Most Important Part

The body is the thick part of the candle between the open and close. It shows you who won that battle:
- **Green/White body** = Buyers won (price closed higher than it opened)
- **Red/Black body** = Sellers won (price closed lower than it opened)

The size of the body tells you how decisive the victory was.

**What the body really means:**

> The body shows where agreement was sustained.

**Large bullish body (close much higher than open):**
1. Buyers were willing to pay higher prices
2. Sellers who wanted cheaper prices disappeared
3. Trades kept happening at progressively higher prices
4. Buyers accepted those prices anyway
5. Agreement kept moving upward until time ran out

**Large bearish body (close much lower than open):**
The exact mirror - sellers controlled the terms, buyers stepped back, agreement kept moving downward.

**Small body (doji-like):**
- Buyers tried
- Sellers tried
- Neither side could sustain progress
- Agreement oscillated
- Ended near where it started

Lots of activity. Little resolution.

### Wicks (Shadows)

The thin lines above and below the body. These are important because they show **rejected price action** - prices that were tested but couldn't hold.

- **Upper wick** = Buyers pushed price up, but sellers rejected it and pushed it back down
- **Lower wick** = Sellers pushed price down, but buyers rejected it and pushed it back up

The longer the wick, the stronger the rejection.

**What the wick really means:**

> The wick shows where agreement failed.

Price went there. Trades happened. But agreement collapsed and price couldn't stay.

---

### Body vs Wick - The Clean Distinction

This is crucial to understand:

> The body shows where agreement was sustained.
> The wick shows where agreement failed.

- Body = accepted prices
- Wick = rejected prices

---

### The Body-Wick Ratio

To understand the market, look at the ratio between body and wick:

**Long body / Short wick = One-sided control**
One side dominated. The engine moved price in one direction with almost no resistance.

**Short body / Long wick = Rejection**
One side tried to move price but hit a wall of orders so large they were pushed all the way back.

---

### Why Momentum Candles Look "Strong"

A momentum candle has:
- Large body
- Small or no opposite wick

This means:
- One side pushed
- The other side did not meaningfully resist
- Agreement shifted smoothly

Nothing mystical. Just low opposition.

---

### Why Reversal Candles Have Long Wicks + Small Bodies

This means:
- One side tried hard
- The other side absorbed it
- Agreement snapped back
- Control changed hands

That's a fight - not a trend.

---

## Types of Candles

There are three main candle types to understand. Each one tells you something different about who's in control.

### Pinbar / Hammer

**What it looks like:** Small body with a long wick on one side

**What it means:** Control shift - someone tried to push price in one direction but got rejected hard. This signals a potential change in control.

- Long lower wick (hammer) = Sellers pushed down but buyers said "no" and pushed it back up
- Long upper wick (shooting star) = Buyers pushed up but sellers said "no" and pushed it back down

**Key point:** The rejection wick should be at least 2x the size of the body to be meaningful.

### Doji

**What it looks like:** Very small or no body, with wicks on both sides

**What it means:** Indecision - no one is in clear control. Buyers and sellers are fighting and neither side can win.

**Key point:** A doji after a strong move can signal that the move is running out of steam. It's not a reversal signal on its own, but a warning sign.

### Momentum Candle

**What it looks like:** Large body with small or no wicks

**What it means:** Strength - there is clear control. One side dominated the entire candle from open to close.

- Big green candle with tiny wicks = Buyers in full control
- Big red candle with tiny wicks = Sellers in full control

**Key point:** The lack of wicks is what makes it powerful. No rejection means no resistance to that move.

## Candlestick Patterns

Candlesticks and their patterns tell a story. A single candle gives you information, but multiple candles together can show you shifts in control and potential reversals.

### Engulfing Candle

**What it looks like:** A candle that completely covers (engulfs) the previous candle's body.

- **Bullish engulfing:** A green candle that engulfs the previous red candle. Shows buyers took over from sellers.
- **Bearish engulfing:** A red candle that engulfs the previous green candle. Shows sellers took over from buyers.

**What it means:** A shift in control. The second candle completely overpowered the first, suggesting the new direction may continue.

**Where to look for it:** Most meaningful at support (bullish engulfing) or resistance (bearish engulfing) levels.

### 3 Bar Reversal Pattern

**What it looks like:** Three candles where:
1. First candle moves in the original direction
2. Second candle is small (indecision or pause)
3. Third candle moves strongly in the opposite direction

**What it means:** The trend tried to continue, stalled, then reversed. The third candle confirms the reversal.

**Key point:** The third candle should be a strong momentum candle in the new direction. If it's weak, the pattern is less reliable.

### Head and Shoulders

**What it looks like:** Three peaks where the middle peak (head) is higher than the two side peaks (shoulders).

```
        Head
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
  L Shoulder  R Shoulder
    /\        /\
   /  \      /  \
  /    \    /    \
---------Neckline---------
```

- **Head and Shoulders (top):** Forms at the top of an uptrend. Signals potential reversal down.
- **Inverse Head and Shoulders (bottom):** Forms at the bottom of a downtrend. Signals potential reversal up.

**How to trade it:** The pattern completes when price breaks the neckline (the line connecting the lows between the peaks). Enter on the break or wait for a retest of the neckline.

**Key point:** The pattern takes time to form. Don't jump in early - wait for the neckline break.

### Double (or Triple) Top/Bottom

**What it looks like:** Price reaches the same level two (or three) times and gets rejected each time.

**Double Top:**
```
    /\    /\
   /  \  /  \
  /    \/    \
       Support
```
Price hits resistance twice, fails to break through both times, then drops.

**Double Bottom:**
```
       Resistance
  \    /\    /
   \  /  \  /
    \/    \/
```
Price hits support twice, fails to break through both times, then rises.

**What it means:** The level is holding strong. After two (or three) failed attempts to break through, the market often reverses.

**How to trade it:** Wait for the "neckline" to break (the swing between the two tops/bottoms). That confirms the reversal.

**Key point:** Triple tops/bottoms are stronger signals than double - three failed attempts shows even more conviction that the level will hold.
