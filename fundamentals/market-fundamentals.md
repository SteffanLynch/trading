# What is the "Market"?

The market is simply a place where buyers and sellers exchange assets. When you hear "the market went up" or "the market crashed," it means the prices of assets changed because of buying and selling activity.

## What is Traded?

### Stocks

Shares of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company. Stock prices go up when more people want to buy than sell, and down when more people want to sell than buy.

### Indices

A collection of stocks grouped together to represent a market or sector. For example, the S&P 500 tracks 500 large US companies. You're not buying individual companies - you're trading the overall performance of the group.

### Forex (Foreign Exchange)

Currencies traded against each other in pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY). You're betting one currency will strengthen or weaken against another. The largest and most liquid market in the world.

### Commodities

Physical goods like gold, oil, wheat, or coffee. Prices move based on supply and demand for these raw materials.

### Crypto

Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Highly volatile, trades 24/7, and moves based on speculation, adoption, and market sentiment.

### Futures

Contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. Used for speculation and hedging. Allows you to trade with leverage.

## Market Participants

Not everyone in the market has the same power or purpose:

1. **Central Banks** - Set interest rates and monetary policy. Their decisions move entire markets.
2. **Commercial Banks** - Handle massive currency transactions for clients and themselves.
3. **Hedge Funds** - Large pools of money using advanced strategies to profit.
4. **Multinational Corporations** - Convert currencies for international business operations.
5. **Retail Traders** - Individual traders like you and me. The smallest fish in the pond.

As retail traders, we don't move the market. We read the market and position ourselves to profit from moves created by larger players.

### Banks and Large Players

Banks have two non-negotiable constraints:
- They must trade huge size
- They must control average price

Those two constraints force them to trade slowly and strategically.

**Final truth (no fluff):**

Yes, the market is fractal. But capital is not evenly distributed across fractals.

Money is hierarchical.
Intent is hierarchical.
Authority is hierarchical.

Patterns may appear to be the same on the surface, but the underlying forces are completely different.

# Buyers and Sellers

Trading is a battle between buyers and sellers.

**Buyers** believe the price will go up. They want to buy now at a lower price and sell later at a higher price.

**Sellers** believe the price will go down. They want to sell now at a higher price and buy back later at a lower price.

At any moment, one side is winning. Your job is to figure out which side has control and join them.

# What Are Orders?

An order is just a request to buy or sell. An order is just an instruction.

That's it.

If you go to a shop and say, "I want to buy apples", that's an order.

"I want to buy"
"I want to sell"

In trading, it's the same thing but you don't buy apples — you buy or sell price.

But orders by themselves do nothing. They only matter and are fulfilled when two orders meet.

A trade happens when:
- One person wants to buy at a price
- Another person wants to sell at that same price
- They agree

It's just the execution of two matching orders.

## Types of Orders

There are only two types of orders:

### Market Order = "Buy/Sell RIGHT NOW"

(Market buys/sells → move price)

This is what most beginners use.

You are saying:

"I don't care about price. Just give it to me immediately."

### Limit Order = "Buy/Sell ONLY at this price"

This is the opposite.

You are saying:

"I will only buy IF price comes to me."

So it just sits there, waiting for price to come to the agreed price, and then the order is executed.

The order has been placed but not entered yet. As far as price is concerned, nothing has happened.

# What Moves Price?

Price moves when trades can no longer happen at the current price. Price moves when one side is no longer willing to trade at that price, forcing trades to occur at worse prices.

Imagine a fruit stall:

- Apples cost £1
- People keep selling apples to the stall owner
- He keeps buying at £1

As long as:
- He keeps buying
- Sellers don't need to accept £0.90

The price stays £1.

Even though apples are changing hands constantly.

So price does not go LOWER (or HIGHER), even though trades are happening. Trades can happen without price moving to a new level.

Price only moves down if there are more willing sellers than willing buyers. Similarly, price only moves up if there are more willing buyers than willing sellers.

And price stops moving when there is a balance of buyers and sellers because an equal amount of buyers wanna buy at the same price the sellers want to sell. Everyone is happy. But now if there is a surplus of buyers, there is now higher demand so price increases to entice more sellers to sell, until they match again. It is this constant search for equilibrium.

Price stops at a standstill when incoming sellers meet enough waiting buyers at the same price. Price moves when one side runs out.

The inability to trade at the current price forces price to change.

> Market orders apply pressure. Limit orders offer resistance.
> Price only moves if the other side cannot absorb that pressure. Price movement depends on which side exhausts first.

It's important to note that market orders do not automatically move price and limit orders do not automatically stop price. They interact.

It's just:
👉 Is there anyone left on the other side?

## Price in the Context of Orders

Market orders are more likely to MOVE price. Why? Because you are accepting whatever is offered at that immediate time. But because your order might not be executed immediately, it creates that imbalance in buyers or sellers. It's more desperate and "aggressive". There is greater "intent".

Limit orders are more likely to absorb price. Why? Because by the time price has gotten there, buyers/sellers are already waiting there. Every seller who shows up gets matched with a buyer immediately, and vice versa. Every order is matched automatically and immediately, so there is no imbalance, and so price stays where it is.

But because often time, banks are the ones doing those huge limit orders, all of a sudden, at a certain price range, you have this drastic shift and imbalance of buyers and sellers.

Why? Because these random small scale trades get price to the banks' limit orders and then boom. All of a sudden there are 50,000 buy orders at this price from the bank compared to 2,000 tiny sell orders at this price. So there's loads more buyers than sellers relative to this price point and price skyrockets.

"Absorb price" just means sellers keep selling, but price doesn't fall, because buyers are already waiting there.

> It is all relative to price!! "More buyers than sellers → price goes up" is a shortcut explanation but it hides the real mechanism. The real mechanism is price goes up when there are no sellers left at the current price. Not "more buyers". Instead "no sellers here anymore".

So an order by itself does NOT move price or do anything. It is only when two orders are matched at the same price that an order is executed. But even then, just because an order has been executed or a trade has taken place, that still doesn't have any inherent impact on price. The only thing that inherently affects price is the imbalance of buyers or sellers at any given price.

> Orders express intent.
> Trades happen when intent meets agreement.
> Price moves only when agreement at the current price becomes impossible.

## What Are "Unfulfilled" or "Unfinished" Orders?

Imagine McDonald's gets 1,000 burger orders, but the kitchen can only make 600. What happens? 600 orders are fulfilled and 400 orders are still waiting.

Those 400 are unfulfilled orders.

In trading, it's the same thing. A bank wants to buy a LOT. But only part of their order gets filled. The rest is still waiting at that price.

Those waiting orders:
👉 Stay there
👉 Matter later
👉 Cause price to react again

So now the real question becomes:

If waiting orders "do nothing", how can they stop price later?
