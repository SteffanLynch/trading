# What is the "Market"?

The market is simply a place where buyers and sellers exchange assets. When you hear "the market went up" or "the market crashed," it means the prices of assets changed because of buying and selling activity.

## What is Traded?

### Stocks

Shares of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company. Stock prices go up when more people want to buy than sell, and down when more people want to sell than buy.

### Indices

A collection of stocks grouped together to represent a market or sector. For example, the S&P 500 tracks 500 large US companies. You're not buying individual companies - you're trading the overall performance of the group.

### Forex (Foreign Exchange)

Currencies traded against each other in pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY). You're betting one currency will strengthen or weaken against another. The largest and most liquid market in the world.

### Commodities

Physical goods like gold, oil, wheat, or coffee. Prices move based on supply and demand for these raw materials.

### Crypto

Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Highly volatile, trades 24/7, and moves based on speculation, adoption, and market sentiment.

### Futures

Contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. Used for speculation and hedging. Allows you to trade with leverage.

## Market Participants

Not everyone in the market has the same power or purpose:

1. **Central Banks** - Set interest rates and monetary policy. Their decisions move entire markets.
2. **Commercial Banks** - Handle massive currency transactions for clients and themselves.
3. **Hedge Funds** - Large pools of money using advanced strategies to profit.
4. **Multinational Corporations** - Convert currencies for international business operations.
5. **Retail Traders** - Individual traders like you and me. The smallest fish in the pond.

As retail traders, we don't move the market. We read the market and position ourselves to profit from moves created by larger players.

# Buyers and Sellers

Trading is a battle between buyers and sellers.

**Buyers** believe the price will go up. They want to buy now at a lower price and sell later at a higher price.

**Sellers** believe the price will go down. They want to sell now at a higher price and buy back later at a lower price.

At any moment, one side is winning. Your job is to figure out which side has control and join them.

# What is Trading Then?

Trading is a game of probability.

You will never know what the market will do next. Nobody does. But you can identify situations where the odds favour one outcome over another - and bet on those situations consistently.

**Think of it like a casino, but reversed:**
- A casino doesn't win every hand, but the odds are slightly in their favour
- Over hundreds of hands, that small edge adds up to guaranteed profit
- Trading works the same way - you need a small, consistent edge that plays out over many trades

Trading is about identifying, improving, and executing your edge over the market.

---

## Buyers vs Sellers

At any moment, ask yourself: who is in control?

- Are buyers pushing price up with momentum?
- Are sellers pushing price down?
- Is neither side winning (consolidation)?

Your job is to assess the battle and get on the winning side. Don't fight the side that's in control.

## Catching the Wave

Think of trading like surfing.

You're not creating the waves - you're watching for them, positioning yourself, and riding them when they come. When the wave ends, you get off and wait for the next one.

**What this means:**
- Look for moves that are already forming or about to form
- Get in, ride the move, get out
- If there's no good wave, stay out of the water

We are spectators first. We watch, we wait, and we act only when we see an opportunity.

## Points of Interest

We look for specific price levels where something is likely to happen - places where buyers or sellers are likely to step in.

These include:
- Support and resistance levels
- Previous highs and lows
- Areas where price reversed before

These are the levels where you watch for setups, not random points on the chart.

## How Do You Make Money?

The same principle as any business: buy low, sell high.

**Two ways to profit:**

1. **Going Long (Buying)**
   - You buy at a low price
   - Price goes up
   - You sell at a higher price
   - The difference is your profit

2. **Going Short (Selling)**
   - You sell at a high price (borrowing the asset)
   - Price goes down
   - You buy back at a lower price
   - The difference is your profit

**Simple rules:**
- If you think price will go up → Buy (go long)
- If you think price will go down → Sell (go short)
- If you're wrong, you lose money

## 3 Types of Analysis

There are three ways to analyse the market:

### Fundamental Analysis

Looking at the underlying value - company earnings, economic data, news events, interest rates. Asks "what is this asset actually worth?"

Most useful for longer-term trades and understanding why big moves happen.

### Technical Analysis

Looking at price charts, patterns, and indicators. Asks "what is price doing and what might it do next based on historical patterns?"

This is what most of your day-to-day trading decisions will be based on.

### Sentiment Analysis

Reading the mood of the market - are traders fearful or greedy? Is everyone bullish or bearish? Sometimes the crowd is right, sometimes they're wrong.

Useful for understanding when moves might be exhausted or when everyone is positioned the wrong way.

---

Most traders focus primarily on technical analysis, with awareness of fundamentals for major news events. You don't need to master all three - but you should understand what each one is.

## What Trading is NOT

### Trading is **not** predicting the future.

Beginners try to forecast exactly what price will do. They say "the market will hit this target" or "this stock will go to $X."

Professionals think differently. They:
- Measure who has control (buyers or sellers)
- Follow the trend until it shows signs of ending
- Manage their positions based on what the market is actually doing

You're not a fortune teller. You're a probability manager.
