# What is Risk Management

Risk management is how you protect your trading account from losing too much money. It's the most important skill in trading.

**Why traders fail:**
1. Poor psychology (emotions, discipline)
2. Poor risk management

You can have a winning strategy, but without proper risk management, a few bad trades can wipe out your account. Risk management keeps you in the game long enough for your edge to play out.

## Risk to Reward (R:R)

How much you're willing to risk compared to how much you could gain. Written as a ratio.

**Examples:**
- 1:2 R:R = Risking $100 to potentially make $200
- 1:3 R:R = Risking $100 to potentially make $300

**The higher the reward, the better.** A higher reward ratio means you can be wrong more often and still be profitable.

### Why R:R Matters

| Risk:Reward | Win Rate Needed to Break Even |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 1:1 | 50% |
| 1:2 | 33% |
| 1:3 | 25% |
| 1:4 | 20% |

With a 1:3 R:R, you only need to win 1 out of every 4 trades to break even. Win 2 out of 4 and you're profitable.

**Profitability = Win Rate × Average Risk to Reward**

You can have a low win rate and still make money if your winners are bigger than your losers.

### The Minimum Standard

**The minimum risk to reward ratio you should take is 1:2, ideally 1:3.**

Anything less than 1:2 means you need to win more than half your trades just to break even - and that's hard to do consistently.

## Stop Loss

A stop loss is an order that automatically closes your trade at a set price to limit your loss.

**Where to place it:** Your stop loss should be placed just beyond the point where your trade idea is proven wrong.

- If you're buying at support, your stop goes just below that support level
- If you're selling at resistance, your stop goes just above that resistance level

If price hits your stop, it means your analysis was wrong - and that's okay. The stop protected you from a bigger loss.

### The Non-Negotiable Rule

**You must always have a stop loss. This is non-negotiable.**

Trading without a stop loss is gambling. One bad trade can destroy weeks or months of gains. A stop loss defines your maximum risk before you enter the trade.

You can get away without a take profit (though it's recommended). But a stop loss? Always. Every single trade.

## Take Profit

A take profit is an order that automatically closes your trade at a set price to lock in your gains.

**Where to place it:** At a logical target where price is likely to reverse or stall:
- The next support/resistance level
- A previous high/low
- A measured move target (like the height of a pattern)

**Why use one:** It removes emotion from the exit. Without a take profit, you might hold too long and watch your profit disappear, or exit too early out of fear.

# The Maths of Trading

You don't need to be good at maths to trade, but you need to understand these basics.

## Pips

A pip is the smallest standard price movement in forex. For most currency pairs, it's the fourth decimal place.

**Example:** If EUR/USD moves from 1.1000 to 1.1001, that's a 1 pip move.

Pips are how you measure:
- How far price has moved
- The size of your stop loss and take profit
- Your profit or loss on a trade

*Note: In other markets (stocks, crypto, futures), the equivalent is called "points" or "ticks."*

## Lots and Position Sizes

A lot is the size of your trade. It determines how much you make or lose per pip.

**Standard lot sizes in forex:**
| Lot Type | Size | Value per Pip (approx) |
|----------|------|------------------------|
| Standard | 100,000 units | $10 per pip |
| Mini | 10,000 units | $1 per pip |
| Micro | 1,000 units | $0.10 per pip |

The larger your lot size, the more money you make or lose for each pip of movement.

## Risk Per Trade

**The rule: Risk no more than 1-2% of your account per trade.**

This is the most important number in risk management.

**Why 1%?**
- If you lose 10 trades in a row (it happens), you've lost 10% of your account - painful but recoverable
- If you risk 10% per trade and lose 10 in a row, you've lost your entire account

**How to calculate position size:**

1. Decide how much of your account you're willing to risk (e.g., 1%)
2. Measure your stop loss distance in pips
3. Calculate the lot size that makes your stop loss equal to 1% of your account

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss: 50 pips
- Position size: $100 ÷ 50 pips = $2 per pip = 0.2 lots (2 mini lots)

If your stop loss gets hit, you lose exactly $100 (1% of your account). No more, no less.

## Summary

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Always use a stop loss | Defines your maximum risk, protects your account |
| Risk 1-2% per trade maximum | Keeps you in the game after losing streaks |
| Minimum 1:2 risk to reward | Allows profitability even with lower win rates |
| Calculate position size based on stop loss | Ensures consistent risk across all trades |

Risk management isn't exciting, but it's what separates traders who survive from those who blow up their accounts.
