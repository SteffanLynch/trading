The market is always doing one of two things: **trending** or **consolidating**. Understanding which state the market is in determines how you trade it.

## Trending

A trend is the market moving directionally - either up or down. Trends are made up of two components:

### Impulse / Extension

The strong, directional move in the trend's direction. This is where the market shows its hand and moves aggressively. These moves tend to have large momentum candles with small wicks.

### Retracement / Pullback

The pause or counter-move against the trend. After an impulse, the market "breathes" - it pulls back before continuing. Pullbacks are where smart traders look for entries, not during the impulse (chasing).

**The rhythm of a trend:** Impulse → Pullback → Impulse → Pullback → Impulse...

### Uptrends

**Definition:** Higher highs and higher lows.

Each swing high is higher than the previous swing high. Each swing low is higher than the previous swing low.

```
        HH
       /  \
      /    \
    HL      \  HH
   /  \      \/  \
  /    \    HL    \
 /      \  /       \
/        \/
```

**Key insight:** In an uptrend, the pullbacks (higher lows) are your opportunity. Wait for the pullback, then enter in the direction of the trend.

---

### Downtrends

**Definition:** Lower highs and lower lows.

Each swing high is lower than the previous swing high. Each swing low is lower than the previous swing low.

```
\
 \        /\
  \      /  \
   \    /    LH
    \  /LH     \
     \/  \      \
     LL   \      \
           \      \
            \     LL
             \
```

**Key insight:** In a downtrend, the rallies (lower highs) are your opportunity. Wait for the rally, then enter in the direction of the trend.

---

### Break of Structure (BOS)

A break of structure confirms trend continuation. It happens when price breaks beyond the previous swing high (in an uptrend) or swing low (in a downtrend).

- **Uptrend BOS:** Price breaks above the previous high → trend continues
- **Downtrend BOS:** Price breaks below the previous low → trend continues

This is your confirmation that the trend is still alive.

### Elliott Wave Theory (Brief Mention)

Elliott Wave suggests trends move in 5 waves: three impulse waves (1, 3, 5) in the trend direction, separated by two corrective waves (2, 4) against it. This is followed by a larger correction (A, B, C).

**The practical takeaway:** Don't overcomplicate this. Just understand that trends tend to have multiple "legs" or pushes before they exhaust. The third impulse (wave 3) is typically the strongest and longest.

---

## Consolidation (Ranging)

The market consolidates **85-90% of the time**. Price bounces between a ceiling (resistance) and floor (support) without making new highs or lows.

**When starting out:** Avoid trading consolidation. It's choppy, unpredictable, and will stop you out repeatedly. Wait for a clear trend or a breakout from the range.

**For more experienced traders:** Ranges can be traded by buying at support and selling at resistance - but only with tight stops and the understanding that breakouts will eventually happen.

**Key insight:** Consolidation is the market building energy. The longer and tighter the consolidation, the more explosive the eventual breakout tends to be.

## Important Concepts

### Contrary Trends (Nested Trends)

**AKA internal and external trends**

Smaller trends exist within larger ones - don't be confused by this.

**Example:** What looks like a downtrend on the 5-minute chart might just be a pullback within an uptrend on the 1-hour chart.

**Rule:** Always check the higher timeframe to understand the bigger picture. Trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend when possible.

### Change of Character (ChoCh)

A change of character is the first warning sign that a trend may be reversing. It's when price breaks a key level that it "shouldn't" break if the trend were still healthy.

- **In an uptrend:** A ChoCh happens when price breaks below a recent higher low
- **In a downtrend:** A ChoCh happens when price breaks above a recent lower high

**Important:** A ChoCh is a warning, not a confirmation. It means the trend is weakening, but it doesn't guarantee a reversal. Wait for further confirmation before trading against the original trend.

### The Trend is Intact Until It Isn't

**Critical rule:** As long as the previous significant low (in an uptrend) or high (in a downtrend) is not broken, the trend is still intact.

Don't let a pullback scare you out of a trend trade. Pullbacks are normal and expected. The trend only ends when structure breaks:
- Uptrend ends when price breaks below the previous higher low
- Downtrend ends when price breaks above the previous lower high

**Don't get caught out:** Many traders exit too early because a pullback "looks" scary. Trust the structure. If the key level holds, the trend continues.
