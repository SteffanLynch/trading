Steffan's Trading Strategy

- must have a pause/indecision and then continuation in the same direction off of a recent swing high or low.

- must have a clear and obvious target for the take profit. either a swing high or swing but but must be the candle body, not wick

- must not have a similar set up in the opposite direction that would nullify and invalidate this trade

- must have at least a 3:1 reward to risk ratio.

- (on the 1hr timeframe) the trade must be entered/triggered with 24 bars of the setup or indecision candle(s). Ideally within the first 12 bars.

- (on the 1hr timeframe) once trade has been entered/triggered, take profit should be hit within 36 bars but no more than 48hrs.



- there must be an unmitigated imbalance or an fair value gap created by the momentum after the indecision. if it is, the trade is invalidated and null.

- it must be highest swing high or lowest swing low in nearby price action

- AM pairs are: GBPCHF, EURCHF, EURGBP, GBPUSD
- PM pairs are: USDJPY, CADJPY, USDCAD


Context is king

We are trading imbalance. The market is largely random and efficient, but we’re looking for parts where it’s somewhat predictable and inefficient.


duration is important is because we need to know how long we need to give the market for our system to profit and also more emotionally and mentally messed

Leverage

Personal risk management rules

DO NOT TRADE REAL MONEY UNTIL YOU HAVE DISPLAYED CONSISTENT PROFITS! NO NEED TO LOSE MONEY UNCESSARILY!

Paper trading is a great option.

and even when you arer ready for real money! start off only with £100 account!

trading also doesnt have to be difficult. it is at the beginning and its long. but it doesnt have to be.

and there is no right way of doing something.

positive expectancy in win-loss ratio and profitablity

drawdown
liquidity

The majority of traders see it as gambling or a luck-based game.
