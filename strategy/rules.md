# Trading Rules

These are the non-negotiable rules. Follow them every time, no exceptions.

## Risk Rules

### Minimum Risk to Reward: 1:3

The lowest risk to reward we trade is 1:3. No exceptions.

If you can't find a setup with at least 1:3, don't take the trade. Wait for a better opportunity.

### No Correlated Trades

Don't trade the same currency in two active trades at the same time.

**Example:** If you have an open trade on EUR/CHF, you cannot then trade EUR/GBP or EUR/JPY. These are conflicting trades because the EUR is going to have an influence on both.

**Why this matters:** If the EUR moves strongly in one direction, it affects all your EUR trades at once. You're not diversifying risk - you're doubling down on the same bet without realising it.

**Rule:** One currency, one trade at a time.

## Entry Rules

### Check for Reasons NOT to Take the Trade

Before entering, make sure there are no conflicting reasons to avoid the trade.

Ask yourself:
- Is there inducement nearby that could stop you out first?
- Is there liquidity sitting just beyond your stop loss?
- Are there stronger zones or levels that could act as magnets pulling price against you?

A setup can look perfect and still be a bad trade if there's something working against it.

### Protect Your Stop Loss

Make sure there's no reason to drive price beyond your stop loss, even if your overall bias is correct.

**Example:** Your bias might be bullish and ultimately correct, but if there's liquidity sitting just below your stop loss, price might sweep that liquidity first before going in your direction. You'd be right about direction but still get stopped out.

**Before every trade, ask:** What's between my entry and my stop? Is there anything that could pull price through my stop before it goes my way?

## Understanding Rules

### Know Why You're Doing It

If you don't understand why you're doing what you're doing, don't do it.

Understand it before you execute it.

- Don't take a trade because someone else said to
- Don't copy a setup you saw online without understanding the logic
- Don't use an indicator if you don't know what it's actually measuring

If you can't explain why you're taking a trade in simple terms, you shouldn't be taking it.

## Documentation Rules

### Journal Everything

Log and journal your trading journey. That's what it is - a journey.

Record:
- Every trade you take
- Your reasoning for entering
- The outcome
- What you learned

Your journal is how you improve. Without it, you're just guessing at what's working and what isn't.

## Pre-Trade Checklist

Before every trade, run through these questions:

1. Is the risk to reward at least 1:3?
2. Am I already in a trade with any of these currencies?
3. Are there any conflicting factors (inducement, liquidity, stronger zones)?
4. Is my stop loss in a safe location?
5. Can I explain why I'm taking this trade?

If any answer is wrong, don't take the trade.
