# Why Supply & Demand Works

Supply & demand only works because large players cannot enter instantly.

Supply & demand zones exist because large passive orders were placed and not fully filled.

## What Is a Reliable Demand Zone?

A reliable demand zone is a place where:
- Big buyers were quietly buying
- They did not finish
- Price moved away strongly
- Some buy orders are still waiting

When price comes back:
- Those orders fill
- Price reacts again

Nothing mystical. Nothing technical. Just unfinished business.

Supply & demand zones are places where big traders started buying or selling but didn't finish.

## Why Weren't All Their Orders Filled the First Time?

Imagine ONE exact price: 1.1950

At that price, the market looks like this at that moment:
- People willing to sell at 1.1950: 300 units
- A bank wants to buy: 1,000 units

What happens?
- 300 units trade
- 700 units cannot trade yet

Why not? Because you cannot buy from someone who doesn't exist.

There is no hidden warehouse of sellers.

So:
- The filled part = trades you see
- The unfilled part = orders still waiting

Just a mismatch in how much is available vs how much is wanted.

Because there weren't enough sellers at that price.

---

## Why Does Price React AGAIN When It Comes Back?

Because unfilled orders don't disappear.

If:
- They wanted 1,000 units
- Only got 300
- 700 are still waiting

Then later:
- When price returns
- Sellers arrive again
- Those 700 get filled
- So price reacts again, often strongly

Not because of memory. Not because of magic. Because unfinished business still exists.

> Big players cannot trade all at once without hurting themselves. So they choose prices they believe are good value. They place large orders and wait. If the market doesn't give them everything, the rest stays waiting. When price comes back, those orders still matter. That's why some areas keep reacting.

> (Which is also why you should be wary of zones that have been tapped into multiple times, because by that point, the banks and institutions have very few or no orders left unfulfilled the next time price gets there, if at all.)

## The Footprints

Large participants cannot complete execution instantly without moving price. Their unfinished execution leaves footprints.

Those footprints appear as zones where price previously failed and later escaped.

Higher timeframes reveal these constraints more clearly because size and time interact.

Zones weaken as liquidity is consumed.
