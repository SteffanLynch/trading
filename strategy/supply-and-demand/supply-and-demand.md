# My Supply and Demand Strategy

## The Core Concept

I do supply and demand. I call it indecision - where there's a pause in a move, that pause is where I trade.

The pattern:
1. Push
2. Pause (indecision candle)
3. Continuation in the same direction

That pause will be retested, and then price continues in the direction it was going before. So we are trading that the market will retest that indecision candle, and continue in the same direction.

## Context: Support and Resistance

It's always in the context of support and resistance.

- The upward push and pause (demand zone) has to be off the back of a level of support
- The downward push and pause (supply zone) has to be off the back of a level of resistance

The way I see it is that the market, even in different timeframes, is always playing within support and resistance. So even if it's an uptrend - that uptrend, for example, in a 15-minute timeframe, is really just consolidation on a 4-hour timeframe.

So it's always in the context of some level of support and resistance.

## My Process

### Step 1: Mark Support and Resistance

First I zoom out into a high-level overview of the 15-minute chart. I mark the support and resistance lines, but only mark the lines relative to where price action is at currently. If there are more, mark them.

### Step 2: Find Supply/Demand Zones

I find the indecision (supply and demand) within the bounds of support and resistance.

### Step 3: Trade the Zone

I trade that supply/demand zone and target the respective support or resistance, depending which direction the move is in.

## My Timeframe Approach

One key note: I don't change timeframes.

Rather than doing the standard method of top-down analysis (e.g., 4-hour down to 1-hour down to 15-minute), I just stick on the 15-minute.

If I want to see the higher timeframe, I just zoom out so it's more small scale, but I can see the bigger moves within the 15-minute. At that scale, you can't see the detail of the individual candles, but that's alright - you can still see the general move.

I just find that easier for myself.

## The Setup

### 1. Identify Market Structure

Identify market structure with breaks of structure.

### 2. Identify Imbalanced Supply or Demand Zones

We're looking for:
- Demand or supply zones
- In line with push against the key level
- Followed by imbalance (momentum candle)
- Unmitigated

### 3. Set Your Orders

- Set a limit order at the zone
- Take profit: the opposite level of structure
- Stop loss: at the edge of the indecision zone (or the most key level if it is close enough)

## Key Notes

### Zone Must Be Unmitigated

The demand/supply zone must be unmitigated and not retested. Our strategy is built upon the principle of the market retesting and balancing itself. So if the zone has already been retested, that trade and setup is now void.

Only trade supply and demand that hasn't been mitigated or rebalanced.

### Indecision Must Be Amongst Momentum

The indecision/pause has to be amongst decision and momentum. The wicky and stable pause must be in the middle of strong candles and big moves.

The stronger the momentum off the indecision, the better quality supply or demand zone.

### Best Zones Are Doji Candles

The best supply and demand zones are those that are doji candles.

### How Price Should Return to the Zone

The slower price trickles back into the supply or demand zone, the better. It should ideally be a strong push off of the zone, and a slow trickle back in.

### Time in Zone = Weakness

The longer price remains in a zone, the more likely it is to fail. It should only tap or wick into your indecision zone.

### Depth in Zone = Weakness

The deeper price goes into a zone, the higher the chance it will fail.
