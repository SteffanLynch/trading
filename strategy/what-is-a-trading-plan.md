# Why Have a Trading Plan?

Trading without a plan is gambling. A plan removes emotion from your decisions and gives you a consistent process to follow.

**Without a plan:**
- You make decisions based on how you feel in the moment
- You chase trades, overtrade, and revenge trade after losses
- You have no way to measure what's working and what isn't
- You repeat the same mistakes

**With a plan:**
- You know exactly what you're looking for before the market opens
- You have rules that keep you disciplined when emotions run high
- You can review your trades and improve over time
- You build consistency, which leads to profitability

A trading plan doesn't guarantee profits. But trading without one almost guarantees failure.

# What is a Trading Plan?

A trading plan is a written set of rules that covers:
- How you analyse the market
- When you enter a trade
- How you manage risk
- When you exit a trade

It's your personal rulebook. Every decision you make should be covered by your plan. If a situation isn't in your plan, you don't take the trade.

**Why write it down?** When you're in a trade and price is moving against you, your brain will try to convince you to break your rules. A written plan holds you accountable. You can look at it and ask: "Am I following my rules or not?"

## The Goal

You don't need to make huge returns. You don't need to catch every move.

**All you need is a strategy that pays 2-5% per month consistently.**

That might not sound exciting, but:
- 3% per month = 36% per year (before compounding)
- With compounding, that grows significantly over time
- Most professional fund managers would be happy with those returns

The goal is consistency, not big wins.

## Rules for a Good Trading Plan

A good trading plan has these qualities:

### 1. Simple, Repeatable, and Reproducible

If your plan is too complicated, you won't follow it. You should be able to explain your strategy in a few sentences.

- Can you follow it every day without confusion?
- Can you teach it to someone else?
- Does it give you the same signals regardless of your mood?

### 2. Comprehensive

Your plan should cover everything from start to finish. No gaps, no "I'll figure it out in the moment."

## What Your Plan Must Include

### Entry Rules

**When do you enter a trade?**

Be specific. Not "when price looks good at support" but:
- Price reaches a key support level identified on the 4H chart
- A bullish engulfing candle forms on the 15-minute chart
- The candle closes above the previous candle's high
- I enter on the next candle

The more specific, the less room for emotional decisions.

### Analysis Method

**What concepts and tools do you use to analyse the market?**

Define this clearly:
- What timeframes do you use?
- How do you identify the trend?
- How do you mark support and resistance?
- What patterns or candle formations do you look for?
- Do you use any indicators? Which ones and how?

Your analysis method should be the same every time. This is your process for finding trade opportunities.

### Risk Management

**How do you protect your account?**

- What percentage of your account do you risk per trade? (e.g., 1%)
- What is your minimum risk to reward ratio? (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3)
- Where do you place your stop loss?
- Where do you place your take profit?
- Do you move your stop loss to breakeven? When?
- Do you take partial profits? At what point?

### Trading Rules

**What are your boundaries?**

- What markets do you trade?
- What times of day do you trade?
- How many trades per day maximum?
- How many losses in a row before you stop for the day?
- What's your daily/weekly profit target?
- What's your daily/weekly loss limit?
- Do you trade during news events or avoid them?

These rules keep you from overtrading and protect you from yourself on bad days.

## The Need for a Trading Journal

A trading plan tells you what to do. A trading journal tells you what you actually did.

**Why you need one:**
- Track every trade you take (entry, exit, result, notes)
- Review whether you followed your plan
- Identify patterns in your mistakes
- See what's working and what isn't
- Improve your strategy based on real data, not feelings

Without a journal, you're guessing. With a journal, you're learning.

**What to record:**
- Date and time
- Market/pair traded
- Entry and exit prices
- Stop loss and take profit levels
- Risk to reward
- Whether you followed your plan (yes/no)
- What you did well
- What you could improve
- Screenshot of the trade

Review your journal weekly. Look for patterns. Your biggest improvements will come from this review process.
