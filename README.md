# Trading Notes

My personal trading library and documentation.

This is not a course. This is not professional advice. This is just my own journey - notes I've taken as I learn, develop, and grow as a trader.

## Philosophy

Trading can be complicated and overwhelming. There's endless information out there, and trying to learn everything will confuse you more than it helps.

My focus is on being **good enough**, not knowing everything.

Sometimes less is more. Enough is better than everything.

I'm not a professional or master trader. I'm just documenting what I learn along the way. This is for my own reference, and for anyone else who might find it useful.

I'll be updating this as I grow.

## The Curriculum

### Phase 1: The Game (The "Why")

Before touching a chart, you must understand the nature of the environment.

| # | File | Core Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | [What is Trading?](fundamentals/01-what-is-trading.md) | Trading is a game of probability and positive expectancy, not prediction. |
| 2 | [Market Fundamentals](fundamentals/02-market-fundamentals.md) | Price moves because of the matching engine, order book priority, and the interaction between Market and Limit orders. |
| 3 | [Market Nature](fundamentals/03-market-nature.md) | Markets are fractal and cyclical; they move between expansion and contraction while hunting for liquidity. |

**Goal:** Stop treating the market like a "Wizard" and start treating it like a system.

---

### Phase 2: The Map (The "Where")

This is the "Reading the Game" phase where you learn to identify context.

| # | File | Core Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|
| 4 | [Market Structure](fundamentals/04-market-structure.md) | Identifying the trend through Higher Highs/Lows and recognizing the difference between a Break of Structure (BOS) and a Change of Character (ChoCh). |
| 5 | [Timeframes](fundamentals/05-timeframes.md) | The "Ocean Analogy" - understanding that higher timeframes provide clarity while lower timeframes provide noise. |
| 6 | [Support and Resistance](fundamentals/06-support-and-resistance.md) | Identifying "floors" and "ceilings" where previous imbalances occurred, prioritizing higher timeframe levels. |

**Goal:** Stop looking for "signals" and start looking for "locations."

---

### Phase 3: The Execution (The "How")

The final technical layer and the rules for survival.

| # | File | Core Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|
| 7 | [Candlesticks](fundamentals/07-candlesticks.md) | Anatomy of agreement vs. rejection. Using Pinbars, Dojis, and Engulfing patterns to confirm a story already told by structure and levels. |
| 8 | [Risk Management](fundamentals/08-risk-management.md) | The 1-2% risk rule, position sizing, and the non-negotiable nature of stop losses. |
| 9 | [Trading Psychology](fundamentals/09-trading-psychology.md) | Managing the "Big Four" emotions (Fear, Greed, Hope, Frustration) and prioritizing process over outcome. |

**Goal:** Execute with precision, protect the capital, and master the mind.

## How to Use This

**Follow the phases in order. Don't skip ahead.**

Each file builds on the previous one. The "Bridge Logic" at the end of each file will guide you to the next.

Don't try to memorise everything. Understand the concepts, then come back and reference as needed.
