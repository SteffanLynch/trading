# Trading Notes

My personal trading library and documentation.

This is not a course. This is not professional advice. This is just my own journey - notes I've taken as I learn, develop, and grow as a trader.

## Philosophy

Trading can be complicated and overwhelming. There's endless information out there, and trying to learn everything will confuse you more than it helps.

My focus is on being **good enough**, not knowing everything.

Sometimes less is more. Enough is better than everything.

I'm not a professional or master trader. I'm just documenting what I learn along the way. This is for my own reference, and for anyone else who might find it useful.

I'll be updating this as I grow.
