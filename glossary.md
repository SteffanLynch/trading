## Market Structure

**Support**
A price level where buyers tend to step in and push price back up. Acts like a floor.
*Also called: demand zone, floor*

**Resistance**
A price level where sellers tend to step in and push price back down. Acts like a ceiling.
*Also called: supply zone, ceiling*

**Supply and Demand**
The forces that move price. When demand (buyers) exceeds supply (sellers), price goes up. When supply exceeds demand, price goes down. Supply zones are areas where sellers are expected. Demand zones are areas where buyers are expected.

**Break of Structure (BOS)**
When price breaks beyond a previous swing high (in an uptrend) or swing low (in a downtrend). Confirms the trend is continuing.
*Also called: structure break, trend continuation*

**Change of Character (ChoCh)**

*Also called: character change, trend shift warning*

**Fair Value Gap (FVG)**
A gap in price where the market moved so fast that there was no trading in between. Often price returns to "fill" these gaps.
*Also called: imbalance, inefficiency*

**Imbalance**

## Price Action

**Price Action**
The movement of price over time, shown on a chart. Trading based on reading candles and price movements rather than indicators.

**Confluence**
When multiple factors line up at the same level or for the same trade idea. For example: support level + trendline + round number all at the same price. More confluence = higher probability setup.

**Timeframe**
How much time each candle represents. A 5-minute timeframe means each candle shows 5 minutes of price action. Higher timeframes show bigger picture, lower timeframes show more detail.

## Liquidity & Order Flow

**Liquidity**
Where orders are sitting in the market. The market needs liquidity to move - it seeks out areas where stop losses and pending orders are clustered.
*Related: stops, orders, volume*

**Volume**
How many shares/contracts/lots are being traded. High volume = lots of activity and interest. Low volume = less participation.

**Inducement**
A move designed to trick traders into entering the wrong direction, usually to grab their stop losses. The market "induces" traders to enter before reversing.
*Also called: trap, fakeout, stop hunt*

**Smart Money**
Institutional traders, banks, and hedge funds - the big players who move the market. The idea is to trade in alignment with what smart money is doing, not against it.
*Also called: institutions, big players*

**Mitigate / Mitigation**
When price returns to a level where orders were previously placed. Institutions often need price to return to certain levels to fill their large orders or manage their positions.
