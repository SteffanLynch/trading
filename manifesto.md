# My Trading Manifesto

*Read this before every trading session.*

---

## On Probability

- My strategy is an edge, not a prediction.
- I do not, nor try to, know which trade will win or lose.
- I am not here to be right. I am here to be profitable over many trades.
- It's not about the next trade. It's about the next 20 trades.

---

## On Process

- I execute the process from start to finish with complete indifference to the result.
- I do not think. I do not hesitate. I follow the plan.
- If my setup appears, I take it. If it doesn't, I wait.
- I trust the system I built.
- My job is not to predict. My job is to execute.

---

## On Emotions

- I do not attach emotion to individual trades.
- The market owes me nothing.
- I do not assign certainty to any trade.
- I expect to lose on some trades. That is part of the process.

---

## On Patterns and Relationships

- Every trade is a completely unique circumstance.
- I do not create relationships between trades.
- The last trade has no bearing on this trade.
- Individual trades are not important on the grand scale.

---

## On Simplicity

- I keep it simple.
- I do not overthink. 
- I have a plan. I follow the plan. 
- If there is no clear setup, there is no trade.

---

## On Risk

- My stop loss is set. I do not move it.
- I risk no more than I have decided.
- If my stop is hit, my analysis was wrong.
- I do not need to win this trade. I need to survive to take the next one.

---

## On Discipline

- I take the trade when my setup appears, even if I am scared.
- I do not take a trade when my setup is not there, even if I am bored.
- I follow my stop loss, even when it hurts.
- I stick to my position size, even when I am confident.
- I walk away after my loss limit, even when I want revenge.

---

## The Commitment

I am not a fortune teller. I am a probability manager.

I do not predict the market. I respond to it.

I follow the process. The profits will follow.

*Now trade.*
